I am Xinyuan Lu (ÈôÜÊ¨£ÂúÜ), a newly graduated Ph.D. from [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I'm also affiliated with the [Integrative Sciences and Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/about/) at NUS Graduate School. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). I also work closely with [Prof. Liangming Pan](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=JcjjOTUAAAAJ&hl=en) from the University of Arizona and [Prof. Preslav Nakov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DfXsKZ4AAAAJ&hl=en) from MBZUAI. 

My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, with a specific focus on **Reasonings of Large Language Models** and **Fact-Checking**.  

**I'm looking for academic research positions (Postdoctoral Scholar/Research Fellow) now.** Please email me (luxinyuan@u.nus.edu) if you have available openings!
