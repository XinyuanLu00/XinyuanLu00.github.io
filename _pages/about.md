I am Xinyuan Lu (陆欣圆), a Ph.D. student in [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I'm also affiliated with the [Integrative Sciences and Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/about/) at NUS Graduate School. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). 

My primary research interest is Natural Language Processing, specifically focusing on Scientific Fact-Checking. One challenging aspect of this field is verifying real-world **research claims** presented in scientific papers, especially when they incorporate tables of experiment results. **I am highly interested in collaboration and welcome discussions regarding this specific area!!!**

I've also been interested in the psychological aspects of Recommendation Systems, especially analyzing the effects of personality in the current recommendation systems.
