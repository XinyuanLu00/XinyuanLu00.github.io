I am Xinyuan Lu (陆欣圆), a Ph.D. student in [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I'm also affiliated with the [Integrative Sciences and Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/about/) at NUS Graduate School. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). 

My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, with a specific focus on **Scientific Fact-Checking** and **Table Reasoning**. A challenging aspect of this field is the verification of real-world **research claims** found in scientific papers, particularly when they involve tables of experimental results. This verification process often entails multi-step table reasoning and requires providing comprehensive long-form explanations.  **I am highly interested in collaboration (or internship application) and welcome discussions regarding this specific area!!!**

I've also been interested in the psychological aspects of Recommendation Systems, especially analyzing the effects of personality in the current recommendation systems.
