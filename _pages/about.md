I am Xinyuan Lu (陆欣圆), a Ph.D. student in [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I'm also affiliated with the [Integrative Sciences and Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/about/) at NUS Graduate School. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). 

My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, especially Scientific Fact-Checking. 

I've also been interested in the psychological aspects of Recommendation Systems, especially analyzing the effects of personality in the current recommendation systems. 


I'm welcome in any form of discussion or collaboration! Feel free to contact me by `luxinyuan [at] u.nus.edu`
