I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I'm also affiliated with the [Integrative Sciences and Engineering Program (ISEP)](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/about/) at NUS Graduate School. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). 

My primary research interests lie in Fact Checking, especially Table-based Scientific Fact-Checking. 

I've also been interested in personality-based Recommendation Systems, especially analyzing the effects of personality in the current recommendation systems. 

My name written in Chinese is 陆欣圆.
